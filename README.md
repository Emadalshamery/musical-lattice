# Musical Lattice

This project aims to provide an interactive version of the just intonation
lattice that musicians throughout time have discovered and rediscovered.

There will be more here later, but for now, the layout of this lattice was
inspired by [Gary Garrett's blog](http://www.garygarrett.me/?p=995) that talks
about how it was constructed.
